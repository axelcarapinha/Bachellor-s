# C2D - Computer Graphics
## About
Made a short animation based on a given emoji (in my case, the speedboat ðŸš¤), with a "follower" object as part of the scene graph (I chosed a parachutist).
<br/>
Graded with 16 / 20.

## Main challenges
- My own L-system path[^1] (the black symbol on the speeboat). Used "Axel" as the axiom, its letters as the alphabet, and built production rules from there.
- Making realistically randomized clouds
- Islands moving slower if they are more distant from the POV[^2]
- Rope between the boat and the parachutist (because of the different planes conjugated)
- The details of many objects (when making many curves from functions)
