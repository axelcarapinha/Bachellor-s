# 3JS - Computer Graphics

## About
Developed a 3D animation based on an assigned word ("andadora"), while maintaining the decorative swashes[^1] of each letter. 
<br/>
On top of the requested, I generalized the task, so that I could build <u>any</u> word with the letters 'a', 'n', 'd', 'o' and 'r'.
<br/>
Graded with 20 / 20.

## Main Challenges
- The red Dragon (fractal) curve implemented with the modified L-system generator function (by returning the points' coordinates instead of just displaying directly onto the screen).
- Dynamic word insertion (making a dynamic spacement between letters, ...)
- Optimized reuse of swashes (the letter 'd' was made reusing parts of the letter 'a', for example)
- Camera effects and timing (sometimes while synchronizing procedural animations with ones controlled by interpollators)
