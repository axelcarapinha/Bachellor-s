# SVG - Computer Graphics
## About
Built a short videogame based in Pacman while respecting all the requirements (customizable arenas and different escaping logic for the "fugitives").
<br/>
Graded with 19.8 / 20.

## Main challenges
- Declarative SVG generation (with that I was able to import figures from the C2D work)
- Avoiding that a character got cornered, by improving the escaping logic
