# X3D - Computer Graphics

## About
Made a 3D animation based on a given emoji (a rocket), with the scene graph elements assembling from different points at first.
<br/>
Graded with 20 / 20.

## Main Challenges
- Made a generalized code to declaratively describe (with JS) the used objects. It allowed to use functions that returned the coordinates of common geometries (returning coordinates remained crucial for all this projects).
- Generalizing the orbit animation (used for the planets, the rocket, ...) using position interpolators and routes
- Making and maintaining many different object identifiers, to query and use during the animation (in _main.js_)
- Decorative timer (the cube that makes the countdown)
