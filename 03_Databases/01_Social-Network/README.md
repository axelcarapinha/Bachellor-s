# Databases - Ficticious Social Network
Group project (done with <a href="https://github.com/Marimba369">Leonel Marimba</a>), where we made a database with PostGreSQL for a social network of fans of literature.
<br />
Graded with 6 / 6.

## About
In this work the logical relationships were known in advance, so it involded:
- Identifying the private, primary and foreign keys
- SQL commands to create the tables
- SQL queries
- Relational Algebra (to retrieve the same information as the SQL queries)

## Contributions
Both of us did the majority of the work independently in order to be able to practice. I focused specialy on SQL, and he centered on relational algebra.
<br/>
However, due to time constraints, we needed to merge the works. All of my queries were working fine, but some of his relational algebra logic was better, so we submited a version of my queries improved with his methods.
