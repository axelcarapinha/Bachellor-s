# Databases - Transport Company
Group project (done with <a href="https://github.com/Marimba369">Leonel Marimba</a>), where we <u>designed</u> and made a database with PostGreSQL for a ficticious transport company.
<br />
Graded with 6 / 6.

## About
In this assignment, only the requirements were known, thus involving more steps than the previous project.
<br/>
The different tasks were:
- Designing an ER[^1] Diagram from the requirements
- Creating relationhips from the referred diagram
- Identifying the functional dependencies 

Similarly to the previous assignment:
- Identifying the private, primary and foreign keys
- SQL commands to create the tables
- SQL queries (but more complex this time)
- Relational Algebra corresponding to the SQL queries

## My Contributions
- Proposed an alternative diagram based on some tips from the teacher, that ended up being <a href="0_ER-diagram.png">the chosen ER diagram</a>.
- Similarly to the previous assignment, both of us did the work, but this time both focused on SQL, so the queries that performed in less time were kept.
- Half of the relational algebra.
